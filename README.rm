Modal YouTube launcher

Modal YouTube launcher uses the Simple Modal plugin to display an embedded video in a modal window. The YouTube video is set to timeout 1 second before the end of the video and timeout causes the modal window to close.

The reason for the timeout is to prevent the display of related videos, which is also accomplished by closing the window.
